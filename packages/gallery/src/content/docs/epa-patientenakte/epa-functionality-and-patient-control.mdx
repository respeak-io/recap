## Digital Health Card and Data Storage

The ePA system utilizes the standard health insurance card ('Gesundheitskarte') as an entry point [video:01:54]. This card will evolve beyond a simple access card for doctor's appointments and prescription storage [video:01:54]. In the future, it will link to a secure digital repository of personal health data, including findings, medications, laboratory reports, and later, X-ray images and MRI reports [video:01:54].

## Data Visibility for Medical Professionals and Patients

The stored data in the ePA will be visible to all treating doctors, therapists, and pharmacies [video:01:54]. Patients will also have continuous access to their own data via an ePA app [video:01:54].

## Patient Questions Regarding Data Access

Katrin Höhne raises critical questions about data access within the ePA: "Who puts what in? Which doctor can see what and what can I see?" [video:01:54]. She also expresses a desire to potentially hide certain information, stating, "maybe I don't want everyone to see something, maybe I want to hide something" [video:01:54].
