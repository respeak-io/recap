## Summary of Activation Options

There are two main ways to activate the online ID:
1.  **Direct PIN at Rathaus**: During the application at the city hall, you might have the option to set your six-digit PIN immediately [video:17:15].
2.  **Transport-PIN Conversion**: If not, you wait for the instruction letter containing the five-digit Transport-PIN. This PIN is then converted into your personal six-digit PIN using the AusweisApp2 and your smartphone's NFC capability [video:17:35].

Alternatively, an NFC-enabled card reader can be used instead of a smartphone [video:17:47].

## Security Keys

It is important to keep the PUK safe, as it is needed if the PIN is blocked after multiple incorrect entries [video:18:24]. Additionally, there is a 'Sperrkennwort' (blocking password) for further security [video:18:24].

## AusweisApp2 Main Screen Overview

The main screen of the 'AusweisApp2' offers several functions:
*   **Gerät und Ausweis prüfen** (Check device and ID card): To ensure both are ready for use.
*   **Transport-PIN ändern** (Change Transport-PIN): For setting your personal six-digit PIN.

## Remote Access (Fernzugriff)

The 'Fernzugriff' (Remote Access) feature allows the smartphone to be used as a card reader for a computer. By activating remote access, the smartphone becomes visible over a WLAN network, enabling it to function as a card reader for PC-based applications, eliminating the need for a separate physical card reader [video:20:00].
