## Developer Integration Workflow

When integrating your digital services with BundID, you should:

1.  **Identify Trust Level**: Determine the `Vertrauensniveau` required for your specific online application or service.
2.  **Redirect to BundID**: Guide users to the BundID authentication portal, specifying the required trust level.
3.  **Handle Callbacks**: Process the secure callback from BundID after successful user authentication, which will include the user's verified identity data.

The BundID system is designed to lead users step-by-step through the appropriate authentication process based on their chosen method and the required trust level [video:02:10].

## User Guidance and Support

BundID is built with a user-friendly interface that guides individuals through each step of the identification process. For developers creating services, ensure that your application's user experience complements this clear guidance. For additional helpful information and frequently asked questions, refer to the official BundID FAQ page at [id.bund.de/de/faq](https://id.bund.de/de/faq) [video:02:18].
