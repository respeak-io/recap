## FFplay: Command-Line Media Player

FFplay is a simple and portable media player included with FFmpeg, allowing users to quickly play media files directly from the command line. It's useful for previewing output or quickly checking media content. [video:00:50]

**Usage Example:**
```bash
ffplay badger.mp4
```

## FFprobe: Media Metadata Inspector

FFprobe is a powerful tool for extracting comprehensive metadata from multimedia files. It provides detailed information about streams, codecs, formats, duration, bitrate, and more, which is invaluable for analysis and debugging. [video:00:55]

**Usage Example:**
```bash
ffprobe badger.mp4
```
This command will output detailed information about the video, audio, and container properties of `badger.mp4`.

## FFmpeg Libraries for Developers

Beyond the command-line tools, FFmpeg provides a rich set of low-level libraries that developers can leverage to build their own multimedia processing software. These libraries offer granular control over various aspects of media handling. [video:01:00]

Key libraries include:
*   `libavutil`: Utility library (for common functions).
*   `libavcodec`: Codec library (for encoding/decoding audio/video).
*   `libavformat`: Format library (for multiplexing/demultiplexing).
*   `libavdevice`: Device library (for capturing/rendering from/to devices).
*   `libavfilter`: Filter library (for media manipulation).
*   `libswscale`: Swscaler library (for image scaling and pixel format conversion).
*   `libswresample`: Swresampler library (for audio resampling and format conversion).
