## What is ELSTER?

ELSTER (Elektronische Steuererklärung) is the official, free online tax declaration software provided by the German tax authorities (Finanzämter). It allows users to electronically submit their income tax declarations and other tax-related forms directly to the tax office. While it is comprehensive, its interface can sometimes appear bureaucratic compared to commercial alternatives [video:00:24].

### Key Characteristics:
*   **Cost-free**: No charges for use.
*   **Direct Submission**: Directly integrates with tax authorities.
*   **Comprehensive**: Supports a wide range of tax forms and scenarios.
*   **Interface**: May require a steeper learning curve due to its precise and formal structure.

## ELSTER vs. Commercial Tax Software

Commercial tax software solutions often offer a more intuitive user experience, guiding users through the declaration process with explicit prompts to identify potential deductible expenses. However, these solutions typically incur a cost. ELSTER, being free, is a viable alternative for users comfortable with a more direct, form-based input method [video:00:24].

For a comparison of various commercial tax software, users can search for 'Steuersoftware Finanzfluss' or refer to links provided in relevant video descriptions.

## Required Documents for Your Declaration

Before starting your ELSTER tax declaration, gather the following essential documents and information [video:01:15]:

*   **Lohnsteuerbescheinigung (Income Tax Statement)**: Provided by your employer, detailing your gross salary, withheld taxes, social security contributions, etc.
*   **Work-Related Records**: Track the number of sick days, vacation days, and Home Office days. This is crucial for employees to calculate 'Werbungskosten' (income-related expenses).
*   **Nebenkostenabrechnung (Utility Bill)**: For tenants, this statement contains items that can be partially deducted from tax (e.g., household-related services).
*   **Receipts and Proofs**: For any other expenses you wish to deduct (e.g., donations, work-related purchases, insurance premiums), ensure you have the receipts or a clear overview of the amounts.
*   **Previous Tax Declaration (Optional)**: Can serve as a reference for pre-filled data like your tax number or recurring expenses.
