## Access Rights and Durations

The ePA defines specific access rights and durations for different parties [video:06:15]:
*   Health insurance companies have no access to the ePA [video:06:15].
*   Hospitals, doctors, and therapists have access for 90 days after each login [video:06:15].
*   Pharmacists have access for 3 days [video:06:15].

## Patient Customization of Access Rights

Patients can individually restrict these rights within the app [video:06:15]. For example, a specific doctor's access can be limited from the standard 90 days to 3 days, or completely excluded [video:06:15]. Patients can grant authorization to specific individuals, for specific documents, and for a defined duration [video:06:15]. They can also upload their own documents and mark certain documents as "private" so only they can see them [video:06:15].

## Support for Non-Digitally Proficient Individuals

For individuals who are not digitally proficient, such as Katrin's mother, two options exist [video:07:05]:
*   Designate a trusted person as a representative who can manage the ePA via the app [video:07:05].
*   Manage certain matters through the ombudsman offices of the health insurance companies [video:07:05].

## Benefits for Patients with Complex Conditions

Dr. Afzali identifies numerous advantages for patients, especially those with language barriers, cognitive challenges, or complex chronic illnesses [video:07:30]. He states that the ePA can ensure that therapy becomes safer and faster, as all relevant information is readily available [video:07:30].

## Option to Opt Out of the ePA

Individuals who still do not wish to use the digital patient file can generally object to its use at their health insurance companies [video:07:50]. A form to opt out of the ePA is briefly shown [video:07:50]. Katrin is still considering whether to transfer her entire stack of paper records to the ePA [video:07:50].
