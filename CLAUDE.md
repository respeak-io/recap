# Project Guidelines

## Context

- The `README.md` at the project root serves as high-level context and should be kept up to date as the project evolves.
- The `docs/` folder contains plans and design documents. Check these when you need deeper context about the project's architecture, features, or decisions.
- This project uses native Claude Code and the Superpowers plugin, so expect artifacts from both (e.g., skill invocations, plans, worktrees).

## Git

- Use `--no-gpg-sign` for all git commits
- `gh` CLI is not installed. Use `git` commands and provide GitHub URLs for PR creation instead.
