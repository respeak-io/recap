## ePA Security Flaws and Public Scrutiny

The ePA has faced public scrutiny due to reported security flaws, notably identified by the Chaos Computer Club [video:03:55]. Newspaper headlines shown include "Sicherheitslücken bei Patientenakte" (Security gaps in patient files) and "Datenschutz-Rückschlag für elektronische Patientenakte" (Data protection setback for electronic patient files) [video:03:55]. These concerns suggest that personal data could fall into the wrong hands [video:04:09].

## IT Security Expert's Analysis of Risks and Improvements

Wolfgang Straller, an IT security consultant, assesses the risks, stating that controlling such a complex system is "very difficult" and requires a robust architectural setup from the start [video:04:09]. He acknowledges that something "went wrong at the very beginning" but notes that Gematik (the ePA software developer) is now working with the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) [video:04:09]. He expects "drastic improvements" [video:04:09] and suggests that "good hackers" could continuously monitor the system [video:04:09]. Straller emphasizes that "a system of this complexity... cannot be made 100% secure" [video:04:09].

## Role of Patient Consent for Sensitive Data

Dr. Afzali acknowledges security concerns and supports the requirement for doctors to obtain explicit patient consent before entering particularly sensitive data into the transparent ePA [video:05:07].
