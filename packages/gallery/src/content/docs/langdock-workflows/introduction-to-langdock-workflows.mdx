## Welcome and Overview of Langdock Workflows 2.0

Welcome to Langdock Workflows 2.0. This guide will walk through creating, testing, and deploying your first automated workflow to process and categorize customer feedback for your team. We will cover key concepts such as triggers, actions, agents, structured output, data referencing, and the deployment process [video:00:00].

## Creating and Naming a New Workflow

To begin, navigate to 'Workflows 2.0' in the sidebar [video:00:29]. Click on 'New Workflow' and select 'Start from scratch'. Close the chat panel, as it will be covered in another video. Rename your new workflow by clicking 'rename' and entering 'Customer Feedback Analyzer' [video:00:39], then hit save [video:00:48].

## Understanding the Workflow Canvas and Project Outline

The main screen displays the workflow canvas, where you add and connect nodes. Each node acts as a building block, performing a specific task [video:00:50]. The goal for this project is to build a workflow that can collect customer feedback via a form, analyze the sentiment and category using AI, and then send the results to a Slack channel [video:01:06].
