## Advantages of the Online ID

The online ID offers several benefits:
*   **Security**: Data is encrypted using end-to-end encryption, preventing interception or unauthorized viewing [video:04:50]. No data is transmitted without consent via PIN entry [video:05:32].
*   **Flexibility**: Allows completion of administrative tasks (Behördengänge) and business matters online, independent of opening hours [video:05:07].
*   **Simplicity**: Requires only an activated online ID, the app, a PIN, and a smartphone (or card reader) [video:05:18].
*   **Transparency**: Clearly displays which data is being requested and who will receive it [video:05:27].

This function enables online verification, allowing users to identify themselves as German citizens to business partners or authorities [video:05:50].

## Transport-PIN and PUK

New ID cards are accompanied by a letter containing important security information. This includes a five-digit Transport-PIN and a PUK (Personal Unblocking Key), both hidden under scratch-off layers [video:07:35]. The PUK is similar to a mobile phone's PUK [video:07:44] and is crucial for unblocking the PIN if it is entered incorrectly multiple times [video:18:24].
