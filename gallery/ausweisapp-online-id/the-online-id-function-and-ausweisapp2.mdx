## The Online ID Function (eID)

The German ID card features an 'Online-Ausweisfunktion', also referred to as a digital ID. This is enabled by an integrated NFC (Near Field Communication) chip within the card [video:02:45]. This chip allows the card to be read by NFC-enabled smartphones [video:02:54].

## Introducing the AusweisApp2

To utilize the online ID function, a dedicated application is required. The video demonstrates the use of 'AusweisApp2', which is available for free download from app stores [video:03:00].

Upon application for the ID card, officials will inform citizens about the online ID function. During the application, fingerprints are also collected and stored on the ID card [video:03:22]. The initial screen of the 'AusweisApp2' is titled 'Meine (Transport-)PIN ändern' (My (Transport) PIN change) and shows a locked padlock icon [video:04:09].

## Data Stored on the ID Card

The ID card stores various personal details, including:
*   Signature [video:04:09]
*   Date of birth [video:04:09]
*   Nationality [video:04:09]
*   First name [video:04:09]

*   Validity period [video:04:09]
*   Place of birth [video:04:09]
*   Registered place of residence (on the backside of the card) [video:04:09]

These data points are also viewable later through the app [video:16:32].
