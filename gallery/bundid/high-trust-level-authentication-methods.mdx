## Online-Ausweis: The Preferred Option

The **Online-Ausweis** is the recommended authentication method, as it achieves the `Vertrauensniveau Hoch`. This allows users to identify themselves for **all** available online applications [video:00:34]. A key benefit for both users and service providers is the automatic transfer of verified personal data from the ID card directly into the online application form, significantly reducing input errors and saving time [video:00:46].

### Supported Online-Ausweis Types
When choosing `Online-Ausweis`, users can register their BundID account using:

*   **Personalausweis mit Onlinefunktion**: The German ID card with activated online functionality.
*   **Elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel**: The electronic residence permit.
*   **Unionsbürger-Karte**: The EU citizen card.

Users can identify if their ID card has online functionality by looking for a specific logo on the back of the card [video:00:58].

## EU Identity (Non-German) - High Trust Level

For EU citizens who do not reside in Germany, BundID supports identification means from their respective countries. Some of these national identification methods are classified under the `Vertrauensniveau Hoch`, enabling these citizens to access a wide range of German digital services [video:01:15].
