## Understanding n8n Nodes

At its core, n8n utilizes **nodes** to represent individual steps within a workflow [video:00:13]. Each node performs a specific function, which can be categorized as: 

*   **Trigger Nodes**: Initiate a workflow based on an event, such as a new email [video:00:16].
*   **Action Nodes**: Perform an operation in an external service, like downloading an attachment [video:00:18].
*   **Transform Nodes**: Process or manipulate data, for example, parsing an invoice [video:00:20].

By visually wiring these nodes together on a canvas, you construct an automated process that executes whenever its designated trigger fires [video:00:25].
