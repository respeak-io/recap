## 1.1 Overview and Core Capabilities

The Respeak Expert Platform is designed to merge Generative AI with your proprietary data, enabling intelligent interactions and insights. It allows organizations to ingest information through various methods—uploading files, direct connections, or web scraping—and then leverage large language models (LLMs) to query this data. Unlike standard LLMs, Respeak ensures responses are exclusively based on your provided information, not the LLM's internal training data [video:00:15].

**Key Use Cases:**
*   Answering internal company questions.
*   Chatting with technical manuals and documentation.
*   Identifying knowledge gaps within datasets.
*   Assisting customer support operations.
*   Helping engineers understand complex technical documentation more effectively.

This platform aims to provide a secure and efficient way to interact with organizational knowledge, enhancing productivity and decision-making.
