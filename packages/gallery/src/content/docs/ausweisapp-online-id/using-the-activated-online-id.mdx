## Online ID Activation Confirmation

Once the Transport-PIN has been successfully changed, the ID card's online function is activated and ready for use [video:13:30].

## Viewing Personal Data on the ID Card

Users can view the data stored on their ID card at any time through the 'AusweisApp2' by selecting 'Meine Daten einsehen' (View my data) [video:14:26]. This requires re-scanning the ID card with the smartphone and entering the newly set six-digit PIN [video:15:00].

After a successful scan and PIN entry, the app displays the personal data from the ID card, including:
*   Family name (Familienname)
*   Birth name (Geburtsname)
*   First name (Vorname)
*   Doctorate degree (Doktorgrad)
*   Date of birth (Geburtsdatum)
*   Place of birth (Geburtsort)
*   Current address (Adresse)
*   Document type (Dokumentenart)
*   ID number (ID)
*   Nationality ('D' for Deutsch - German)
*   Religious or artist name (Ordens oder Künstlername)
*   Issuing state ('Deutschland' - Germany)

These data are retrieved via the Near Field Communication (NFC) chip [video:16:32].
