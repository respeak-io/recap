## 1. Initial Setup: Trigger and Sources

The workflow begins with a **Schedule Trigger** node [video:01:17], configured to run daily. Following this, an **Edit Fields** node is used to define a list of news sources. These sources are provided as an array of URLs [video:01:21].

#### Example: News Sources in 'Edit Fields' Node
```json
[
  "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml",
  "https://techcrunch.com/feed/",
  "https://arstechnica.com/feed/"
]
```

## 2. Data Retrieval and Filtering

Next, a **Split Out** node [video:01:24] processes the array of news sources, outputting each URL as a separate item. These individual URLs then feed into an **RSS Read** node [video:01:28], which fetches all the latest articles from each source. 

To manage the volume of articles, a **Sort** node is applied to randomize the order [video:01:33], followed by a **Limit** node to select only the first 15 articles [video:01:36]. This ensures a curated, manageable list of news items.

## 3. Summarization with LLM

The selected articles are then passed to a **Basic LLM Chain** node [video:01:40]. Here, a custom prompt is defined to summarize the content of each article and extract its original link. For the Large Language Model (LLM) backend, a **Google Gemini Chat Model** node is integrated [video:01:47], requiring a free API key obtained from Google AI Studio.

#### API Reference: Google AI Studio
To use the Google Gemini Chat Model, you need to obtain an API key from Google AI Studio. This key authenticates your requests to the Gemini model for content generation.

#### Example: LLM Prompt Configuration
```plaintext
"Summarize the following tech news article in exactly three sentences, then provide the original article link immediately after the summary. Ensure the summary is concise and highlights the main points. 

Title: {{ $json.title }}
Content: {{ $json.content }}
Link: {{ $json.link }}"
```

## 4. Sending to Discord

Finally, a **Discord** node [video:01:54] is used to publish the summarized news to a designated Discord server. This node is configured with a webhook URL obtained from the Discord server settings, and the message content is dynamically populated using data from the previous LLM node, creating a rich message with summaries and links [video:01:58].

#### Example: Discord Message Payload
```json
{
  "content": "### Daily Tech News Update \n\n**{{ $json.title }}**\n{{ $json.summary }}\n[Read more]({{ $json.link }})\n",
  "username": "n8n Tech News Bot",
  "avatar_url": "https://example.com/n8n-icon.png" 
}
```

Upon execution, this workflow delivers a daily digest of tech news directly to your Discord server, complete with succinct summaries and direct links to the full articles [video:02:07].
