## Reviewing the Declaration and Troubleshooting Errors

After filling out all relevant forms, it is crucial to review your declaration for completeness and accuracy [video:10:26].

1.  Click the 'Prüfen' (Check) button, usually located at the top of the interface [video:10:30].
2.  ELSTER will identify any missing or inconsistent information. For example, if the 'Steuerklasse' (Tax Class) was not entered, an error message will appear [video:10:35].
3.  Address any errors by navigating directly to the indicated field (e.g., '1 - Angaben zum Arbeitslohn' to set 'Steuerklasse 1') [video:10:45].
4.  After correcting, click 'Prüfen' again to ensure all errors are resolved.

## Understanding the Tax Calculation

Once the declaration passes the 'Prüfen' check, ELSTER will provide an 'unverbindliche Steuerberechnung' (non-binding tax calculation). This calculation will show your expected refund or additional payment [video:10:55].

*   **Erstattung (Refund)**: Indicates the amount you are expected to receive back (e.g., '463,19 €') [video:11:00].
*   **Detaillierte Steuerberechnung (Detailed Tax Calculation)**: A link is usually available to view a granular breakdown of how the final amount was calculated, which can be useful for understanding the impact of your entries [video:11:00].

## Submitting the Declaration

1.  After reviewing the calculation and ensuring everything is correct, click 'Weiter' (Next) [video:11:05].
2.  A summary of your entered data will be displayed for a final check [video:11:08].
3.  Finally, click the 'Absenden' (Submit) button at the bottom to send your tax declaration electronically to the tax office [video:11:10].

**Note**: You will typically need to authenticate the submission using your ELSTER certificate file (`.pfx`) and password.
