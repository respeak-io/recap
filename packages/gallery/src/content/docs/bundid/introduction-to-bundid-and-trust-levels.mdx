## What is BundID?

BundID serves as the central platform for securely identifying individuals to access digital government services (`Behördengänge einfach online erledigen`) in Germany. It streamlines the process of engaging with public administration by offering various secure login options tailored to the sensitivity of the data involved [video:00:00].

## BundID Trust Levels Explained

Online applications (`Online-Anträge`) require different levels of identification based on data confidentiality. BundID categorizes its access options into three distinct trust levels:

*   **Vertrauensniveau Hoch (High Trust Level)**: The highest level, suitable for applications requiring maximum security.
*   **Vertrauensniveau Substanziell (Substantial Trust Level)**: An intermediate level for applications with significant security requirements.
*   **Basisregistrierung (Basic Registration)**: The foundational level for general access [video:00:20].

Developers integrating with BundID must determine the required trust level for the services they provide to ensure appropriate user authentication.
