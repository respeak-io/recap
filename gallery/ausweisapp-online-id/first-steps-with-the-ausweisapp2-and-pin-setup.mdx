## Receiving Your New ID Card

After ordering, it can take up to six weeks to receive the new ID card. A letter will confirm that the new ID card has been produced and sent, and that it includes the online ID function. This prompts the user to make an appointment to pick up the ID card [video:07:07]. The ID card is a plastic card featuring a photograph and various data [video:07:29].

## Activating the Online ID Function

To activate the online ID, open the 'AusweisApp2'. The ID card is not active by default and requires data input. The smartphone must support NFC communication [video:07:54].

The app will ask for the PIN type. Options presented are a six-digit personal PIN, a five-digit Transport-PIN, or no PIN. For initial activation, the five-digit Transport-PIN from the letter is required [video:08:23].

## Entering the Transport-PIN

After selecting 'Fünfstellige Transport-PIN' (Five-digit Transport-PIN) in the app, the phone displays 'Bereit zum Scannen' (Ready to scan). The ID card should then be placed on top of the NFC-enabled smartphone [video:09:59]. The app confirms 'Scannen erfolgreich abgeschlossen' (Scan successfully completed) [video:10:08].

The app then prompts for the Transport-PIN. This PIN is found in the instruction letter, under a scratch-off layer [video:10:20]. Once the Transport-PIN is entered into the numeric keypad displayed on the phone, the process can continue [video:10:08].

## Setting a New 6-Digit PIN

After successfully entering the Transport-PIN, the app prompts the user to 'Neue PIN eingeben' (Enter new PIN). The user must then create a new six-digit numeric PIN [video:11:39]. This new PIN will be used for future data releases and identity verification. It should be unique and easy to remember. The new PIN must be entered twice for confirmation [video:12:35]. After confirmation, the app displays 'Ihre PIN erfolgreich geändert' (Your PIN successfully changed) [video:13:03]. The ID card must remain on the smartphone within the NFC chip's range during this process [video:13:10].
