## Dr. Bahman Afzali: A Pilot Doctor

Dr. Bahman Afzali, a general practitioner with a modern, digitally equipped practice, is one of 230 pilot doctors to receive the ePA software [video:03:20]. He indicates that he would have welcomed the electronic file even sooner, noting it would have greatly simplified the process when 200 patients transferred to his practice after another doctor closed [video:03:20].

## Doctor's Workflow with ePA Software

Dr. Afzali demonstrates his patient documentation system. The upper section of the screen is for the doctor's own practice notes and information [video:03:20]. For example, he types notes such as "Sie sind jetzt heute da. Kopfschmerzen. Ja, möchte, ne, möchte sich die EPA mal anschauen und hat außerdem Kopfschmerzen" (You are here today. Headaches. Yes, wants to, wants to look at the ePA and also has headaches) [video:03:20]. These notes are stored in the doctor's local patient file and may lead to a diagnosis or prescribed medication [video:03:20]. When information needs to be shared with another doctor, the electronic patient file automatically opens in the lower section, allowing documents to be uploaded [video:03:20].

## Benefits of Interoperability for Doctors

Dr. Afzali explains that he can also view entries made by other specialists [video:03:20]. He demonstrates this using his own ePA, scrolling through a list of documents and showing the ability to search by date [video:03:20]. He highlights the significant advantage for medication management, preventing repeated prescriptions of ineffective drugs by ensuring doctors are aware of prior treatments [video:03:20].
