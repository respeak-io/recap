## Enhanced Medication Safety and Management

The ePA significantly enhances medication safety. Upon activation, an integrated medication list provides a digital overview of all medications prescribed and dispensed via e-prescriptions from that point onward. [video:01:45] This digital foundation is crucial for effectively identifying potential interactions between different medications, thereby preventing adverse drug events. [video:01:55]

In a subsequent update, the ePA for all will introduce a comprehensive medication plan. This plan will provide patients with precise details, such as which medications to take, at what times, and in what dosages. [video:02:15] (e.g., 'Take one tablet two times a day,' visually represented as 2x, 3x, 2x). [video:02:25]

### Developer Integration: Medication List Retrieval
Healthcare systems can integrate with the ePA to retrieve a patient's medication list once treatment context is established:

**API Endpoint for Medication List Retrieval (Hypothetical):**
```json
GET /api/v1/patient/{patientId}/medication-list
Authorization: Bearer {treatmentContextToken}
```

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "medications": [
    {
      "id": "MED_001",
      "name": "Ibuprofen 400mg",
      "prescriptionDate": "2024-10-26",
      "dispensationDate": "2024-10-27",
      "prescribingDoctor": "Dr. Schmidt",
      "status": "active",
      "dosageInstructions": "Take one tablet twice daily after meals"
    },
    {
      "id": "MED_002",
      "name": "Amoxicillin 500mg",
      "prescriptionDate": "2024-10-20",
      "dispensationDate": "2024-10-21",
      "prescribingDoctor": "Dr. Müller",
      "status": "completed",
      "dosageInstructions": "Take one capsule three times daily for 7 days"
    }
  ],
  "medicationPlanAvailable": false
}
```

## Data Security and Encryption Standards

Data within the ePA is subject to the highest security standards. All information is transmitted exclusively in an encrypted format, rigorously protecting it from unauthorized access. [video:02:35] This robust encryption ensures data integrity and patient privacy throughout its lifecycle.
