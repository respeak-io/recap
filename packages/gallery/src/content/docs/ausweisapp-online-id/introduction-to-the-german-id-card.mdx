## Purpose and Issuing Authority

The German ID card (Personalausweis der Bundesrepublik Deutschland) is an official document serving as proof of identity for German citizens. It is issued by the ID card authority (Personalausweisbehörde) responsible for the citizen's main residence, typically the local city hall (Rathaus), upon application [video:01:21].

When applying, personal data, including information from any expired ID, is recorded. If a citizen is new to the area or has recently become a resident, their details are registered with the local authority [video:01:33].

## Application Process

Applying for a new ID card typically involves visiting the city hall where you are registered. The ID card itself requires a fee. Once requested, the ID card authority will process the order [video:02:13].
