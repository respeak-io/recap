## 2.1 Querying Your Data and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Users can pose natural language questions to their integrated data, similar to interacting with conversational AI tools. The platform processes these queries using a proprietary **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** engine [video:01:20]. This engine intelligently connects LLMs with your specific, proprietary data, ensuring responses are accurate, relevant, and traceable.

**Example Query:**
"What makes the Respeak Expert Platform special?" [video:00:50]

Upon querying, the system provides a detailed response, drawing directly from the ingested data. For instance, a query about Respeak's uniqueness might highlight its ability to use Gen AI with your data for technical service and customer support, emphasizing the proprietary RAG engine that operates in a GDPR-compliant manner on EU servers [video:01:25].

## 2.2 Understanding Responses: Sources and Reasoning

Every response generated by the Respeak platform comes with comprehensive contextual information:

*   **Source Highlighting**: The central pane of the UI displays the exact text chunks from the original source documents (e.g., website content, PDFs) that were used to formulate the answer. Relevant sections are highlighted, allowing users to verify the information's origin [video:01:45].
*   **Sources Used**: A 'Sources used in answer' section lists all documents (e.g., `respeak.io`, `Megatrend Gaming - Whitepaper.pdf`) that contributed to the current answer [video:01:05].
*   **Additional Findings**: The platform also presents 'Hybrid results' or 'Additional keyword results' from other sources within the expert's knowledge base, which might be relevant but not directly used in the primary answer [video:01:55].
*   **Reasoning**: For simple questions, the 'Reasoning' section explains *why* the answer was generated or clarifies its meaning. For more complex queries spanning multiple documents, it can identify potential conflicts in the data, providing deeper insights into the answer's provenance and reliability [video:02:10].

## 2.3 Multilingual Q&A and User Feedback

The Respeak Expert Platform supports full multilingual interaction. Users can ask questions in one language (e.g., English) and receive answers derived from documents written in another (e.g., German) [video:03:30]. This instant translation capability is powerful for global teams, supporting major languages including French, Spanish, German, and English.

**Example:** Querying a German 'Megatrend Gaming - Whitepaper.pdf' with the English question "Why is gaming relevant for companies today?" [video:03:00] will yield an English response, with the underlying German PDF displayed and highlighted appropriately [video:03:10].

**User Feedback:** The platform includes a mechanism for users to provide feedback on generated responses. Users can rate responses (e.g., 'good' or 'not good') and provide reasons (e.g., 'Imprecise') [video:04:15]. This feedback is crucial for continuous improvement of the system's accuracy and relevance.
