## Categories of Sensitive Data Requiring Consent

Sensitive health data categories that require explicit patient consent for inclusion in the ePA include: psychological or sexually transmitted diseases, abortions, HIV infections, and results of genetic tests [video:05:18]. Visuals show stop signs next to these categories [video:05:18].

## Controlling Data Access via the ePA App

Katrin Höhne wants to maintain control over her data, even less sensitive information, by determining who can see what [video:05:40]. This control is facilitated by the ePA app [video:05:40].

## Challenges with App Registration

Users must download and register for the ePA app [video:05:40]. The registration process, which involves the health insurance card and a PIN, can be problematic. Katrin experiences an "allgemeiner Fehler" (general error) message during her attempt [video:05:40]. It is noted that the registration process "unfortunately works a little differently for each health insurance company" [video:05:40], and users are advised to inquire if they encounter issues [video:05:40].

## Assistance for Digital Literacy

The Verbraucherzentrale NRW (Consumer Advice Centre North Rhine-Westphalia) offers online courses, accessible nationwide, to assist users with both the technical and content-related aspects of the ePA [video:06:06].
