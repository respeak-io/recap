## What is Supabase?

Supabase is a complete backend platform for web and mobile applications, built entirely on free and open-source software (FOSS) [video:0:00]. It aims to simplify the complex task of architecting scalable systems, allowing developers to focus more on application logic rather than infrastructure setup.

## Addressing Proprietary Lock-in

Traditional backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solutions like Firebase and Amplify, while simplifying development, often lock users into proprietary technology and specific cloud platforms (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS) [video:0:15]. This vendor lock-in can limit flexibility and control over your application's infrastructure.

Supabase was created in 2019 as a direct open-source alternative to address these limitations, providing similar capabilities with the freedom of open source [video:0:19].
