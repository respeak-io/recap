## EU Identity (Non-German) - Substantial Trust Level

As part of the eIDAS regulation, various identification means from other EU countries are integrated with BundID. While some may reach `Vertrauensniveau Hoch`, others are classified under `Vertrauensniveau Substanziell`. Developers should be aware of these classifications when designing services for EU citizens [video:01:27].

## ELSTER-Zertifikat: Substantial Trust

The **ELSTER-Zertifikat** is an authentication option that falls under the `Vertrauensniveau Substanziell`. This option is available to users who already possess an ELSTER account and the corresponding certificate, commonly used for tax-related services [video:01:38].

### Developer Note on ELSTER Integration
Integrating services that require `Vertrauensniveau Substanziell` may offer ELSTER-Zertifikat as a direct authentication path, leveraging existing user credentials within the ELSTER ecosystem. Developers should guide users clearly through the process, potentially linking to ELSTER's own authentication flow.

## Basic Registration: Username & Password

The **Benutzername & Passwort (Username & Password)** option constitutes the `Basisregistrierung`. This method provides the most basic level of access and is suitable for applications with low confidentiality requirements [video:01:54].

### Universal BundID Account Creation
It's important to note that regardless of which higher-level option (Online-Ausweis, ELSTER-Zertifikat, etc.) a user chooses for initial account creation, they will **always** be required to set up a username and password for their BundID account. This provides a consistent fallback or alternative login method for users [video:02:05].
