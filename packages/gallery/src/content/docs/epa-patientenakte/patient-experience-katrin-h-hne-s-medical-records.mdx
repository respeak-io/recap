## Extensive Paper Medical Records

Katrin Höhne, a statutory insured individual, manages a significant volume of paper medical records. She presents several large blue and red binders containing documentation for her knee operations, including X-ray images and medical reports [video:00:50]. This collection highlights a "Zettelwirtschaft" (paper chaos) [video:01:54]. Katrin expresses a strong desire for this "paper economy to end" and for everything to be in one digital file [video:01:54].

## Initial Understanding and Concerns

Katrin Höhne has limited initial knowledge about the ePA but has heard that it allows patients to control who can view specific documents [video:00:30]. While she finds this positive, she admits to having "no idea" what to expect from the ePA [video:00:30].
